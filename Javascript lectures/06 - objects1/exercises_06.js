// this
// closure

// - take a look over the javascript closure from documentation

// // 1. please waf prototype whcj implements the map BUT not returns another instance of the array; mymap

// // 	- [1,2,3] ==> [1,4,9]
// // 	arr1 --> arr2

// // 	arr1 --> arr1 [1,4,9]

// // Array.prototype.mymap ....

// 2. Please write a system for a store.
// The store have n shelf.
// every shelf can have the following settings
// 	- color
// 	- light intensity

// 	- type
// 		- sport
// 		- toys
// 		- jewelry
// 		- clothes
// 		- presentation (the products from this shelf cannot be sold and has no price)
// 	- allowedProductNumbers - how many products can fit into the shelf

// when the color or light intensity is changed, this setting it will be aplied to all shelf

// On a shelf you can put maximum "allowedProductNumbers" products;

// every product has a
// 	- cost
// 	- profit;
// 	- price = cost + profit
// 	- code; generate 5 random characters
// 	- type (same as shelf type)

// Design a system like this
// the store can:
// 	receive a product; it will be added on a shelf; if there is no shelf, it will return false
// 	provide the sum of all products
// 	provide the sum of all products for every category
// 	sell a product with a specific code
// 	add more shelfs
// 	reserve a product for a period; in this case the product cannot be sold
// 	the store will keep a history of sold products

// 3. create another store with exact data from 2;
